Requirements:

   Discord desktop app running

    pypresence (pip install pypresence)


## In the mpv-tui.py file 
#### Here, instead of "path-to-discord-mpv.py" specify the path to the downloaded discord-mpv.py
```python
  # Start Discord RPC handler
            script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
            discord_rpc_script = os.path.join(script_dir, 'path-to-discordmpv.py')
            self.rpc_process = subprocess.Popen(
                ['python3', discord_rpc_script, self.ipc_socket],
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.PIPE
            )
```

## Custom Image Setup:

  Create a Discord application at Discord Developer Portal

  
  Navigate to your application > Rich Presence > Art Assets

  Upload your image (minimum 512x512, recommended 1024x1024)

  Note your Application ID (needed for CLIENT_ID in code)

######  -------------- You might need to wait a few minutes for the Art Assets to actually take effect

#  Configuration:

  Open discord-mpv.py and replace the CLIENT_ID with your application ID:

  ```bash
  CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE"  # Replace with your Discord app ID
```

The default image key is set to "mpv" - change this to match your uploaded image name:

```python
self.rpc.update(
    # ...
    large_image="mpv",  # Change this to your image key
    # ...
)
```


## Running with Discord Integration

```bash
# Run normally (will auto-launch discordmpv.py when played a song)
./mpv-tui.py
```

## Enjoy your terminal music experience
